                    "Remember why you started. Every challenge you face is an opportunity to learn and grow. Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle. Stay consistent, stay curious, and never stop learning. You have the potential to build amazing things. Trust the process, celebrate small wins, and keep pushing forward. The best version of yourself is yet to come."

                <p data-testid="test-about-extra">
                    Beyond coding, I'm passionate about community building, mentorship, and creating inclusive spaces in tech. I believe that diversity of thought leads to better solutions. I'm also interested in the intersection of technology and social impactâ€”how we can use our skills to make a positive difference in the world. In my free time, I enjoy reading about emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and helping others navigate their tech journey.
