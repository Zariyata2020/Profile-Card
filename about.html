                    I’m Zariyat Adeniran, a curious and driven Full Stack Developer from Nigeria. I love building things that make life easier, whether it’s a clean user interface or a backend system that just works. My journey into tech started with a simple desire to understand how websites function, and it’s grown into a full-blown passion for solving problems through code. I enjoy learning, experimenting, and sharing what I know with others. For me, tech isn’t just about tools, it’s about impact. </p>

    Beyond coding, I’m deeply passionate about community building, mentorship, and creating inclusive spaces in tech. I believe that when people from different backgrounds come together, we build better things. I’m also interested in how technology can drive social change from education to accessibility. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring new ideas, and helping others find their path in tech.
